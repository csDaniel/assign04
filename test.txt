multtable.php
	+ min-multiplicand
	+ max-multiplicand
	+ min-multiplier
	+ max-multiplier

1. check min is less than or equal to max multiplicand
2. min is less than or equal to min multiplicand
3. print error message for each invalid input
	"[min-multiplicant..] must be an integer"
	"missing parameter [min-mutliplicant...]"
4. produce a table that is (max-multiplicant - min-multiplicand + 2) tall
	(max-multiplier -min-multiple + 2) wide

table: 
	left colum = multiplicand
	top row = multiplier

To accomplish the above task you will want to work with loops to dynamically 
create rows and within each row, loop to create the cells. It should output as a 
valid HTML5 document.
